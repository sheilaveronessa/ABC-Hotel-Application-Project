This is a customized application created using the ServinceNow Platform aimed to simplify and streamline the online booking process of a hotel business.
This was achieved by configuring lists and form views, implementing a flow using Flow Designer, creating multiple dashboards, integrating a Record Producer into the Employee Service Portal, and establishing a Knowledge Base.
As the Project Manager, I demonstrated my expertise and skills in managing all areas of the project from beginning to end.
